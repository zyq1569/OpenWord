/**
 * This class connects KoShapeAnchor to a position in the text document.
 *
 * This class is used when the shape anchor is of type: char or paragraph
 *
 * It has to be registered to the textrange manager and thus forms the connection between the text
 * and the KoShapeAnchor and by extension the so called 'anchored-shape' (any kind of shape)
 *
 * The KoAnchorTextRange is placed at a position in text. As with all KoTextRange it will change
 * it's position in the text when the user edits text before it. The user is also able to delete it if
 * deleting the text where it is positioned.
 *
 * The anchored-shape can be repositioned on the canvas if the text is relayouted (for example after
 * editing the text. This is dependent on how the text layout is implemented.
 *
 * Steps to use a KoAnchorTextRange are
 * <ol>
 * <li> Create KoShapeAnchor *anchor = new KoShapeAnchor(shape);
 * <li> Use anchor->loadOdf() to load additional attributes like the "text:anchor-type"
 * <li> if type is char or paragraph create KoAnchorTextRange *anchorRange = new KoAnchorTextRange(anchor);
 * </ol>
