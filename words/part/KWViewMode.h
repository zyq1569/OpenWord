/**
 * Abstract base class for KWCanvas's view modes.
 * A viewMode is a strategy inserted between the canvas and the document.  A document
 * normally is nothing but a very tall area for drawing with some artificial limitations
 * imposed by the pages (KWPage).  A viewmode can, for example, choose to paint page
 * outlines and translate the document coordinates so the pages get painted correctly
 * and mouseclicks on the canvas get converted into real document coordinates.
 *
 * On the implementation side the viewMode will not have the notion of zoom; its using
 * the viewconverter for that.  This means that to the user of this API zooming
 * is applied just like translation is.
 *
 * This class provides a layer on top of the KoViewConverter and Words should not use that
 * interface directly.
