/** Calligra's undo/redo framework.
    The @c KoTextEditor undo/redo framework sits between the @c QTextDocument and the application's undo/redo stack.

    When the @c QTextDocument is changed by an editing action, it internally creates an undo/redo command. When doing so a signal (undoCommandAdded()) is emitted by the @c QTextDocument in order for applications to update their undo/redo stack accordingly.
    Each @c QTextDocument used in Calligra is handled by a specific @c KoTextEditor. It is responsible for on the one hand edit the @c QTextDocument, and on the other hand to listen for the QTextDocument's signal.

    Calligra uses a @c KUndo2Stack as its application undo/redo stack. This stack is populated by @c KUndo2Command or sub-classes of it.

    In order to limit the number of command sub-classes, KoTextEditor provides a framework which uses a generic command.

    The framework is based on a sort of state machine. The KoTextEditor can be in several different states (see KoTextEditor::Private::State).
    These are:
    NoOp: this states indicates that the KoTextEditor is not editing the QTextDocument.
    KeyPress: this state indicates that the user is typing text. All text typed in succession should correspond to one undo command. To be used when entering text outside of an insertTextCommand.
    Delete: this state indicates that the user is deleting characters. All deletions done in succession should correspond to one undo command. To be used for deleting outside a deleteCommand. Currently not in use, our deletion is done through a command because of inline objects.
    Format: this state indicates that we are formatting text. To be used when formatting outside of a command.
    Custom: this state indicates that the QTextDocument is changed through a KUndo2Command.

    KoTextEditor reacts differently when receiving the QTextDocument's signal, depending on its state.

    In addition the framework allows to encapsulate modifications in a on-the-fly created custom command (\sa beginEditBlock() endEditBlock()).
    Furthermore the framework allows to push complete KUndo2Commands.

    See the documentation file for how to use this framework.

/*
  Important members:

  commandStack: This stack holds the headCommands. These parent the generated UndoTextCommands. When undo or redo is called, they will in turn call UndoTextCommand::undo/redo.

  editorState: Holds the state of the KoTextEditor. see above

  commandTitle: Holds the title which is to be used when creating a headCommand.

  addNewCommand: bool used to tell the framework to create a new headCommand and push it on the commandStack, when receiving an undoCommandAdded signal from QTextDocument.

  customCommandCount: counter used to keep track of nested KUndo2Commands that are pushed on the KoTextEditor.
  */


// This slot is called when the KoTextEditor receives the signal undoCommandAdded() from QTextDocument. A generic UndoTextCommand is used to match the QTextDocument's internal undo command. This command calls QTextDocument::undo() or QTextDocument::redo() respectively, which triggers the undo redo actions on the document.
//In order to allow nesting commands, we maintain a stack of commands. The top command will be the parent of our auto generated UndoTextCommands.
//Depending on the case, we might create a command which will serve as head command. This is pushed to our commandStack and eventually to the application's stack.
