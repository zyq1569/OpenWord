 * This is an abstract class supposed to be inherited only. DO NOT instantiate this class directly.
 *
 * On top of the standard QAbstractItemModel methods to re-implement, there are 3 specific methods which need to be re-implemented in order to be used with the styles widgets:
 * - setStyleThumbnailer: a @class KoStyleThumbnailer is used to layout/draw a preview of the style
 * - indexOf: for a given character or paragraph style, returns the corresponding QModelIndex
 * - stylePreview: returns a QImage, preview of the given style (given as row number in the list model)
 *
 * Following assumptions are made:
 * - the AbstractStylesModel derived model is a flat list of items (this also means that "parent" QModelIndexes are always invalid)
 * - the AbstractStylesModel derived model has only one column
 * - there is no header in the AbstractStylesModel derived model
